Bots for Telegram. Get notifications on new events like new commits, pipelines, etc.

</div>

Notifine helps with events in your work tools like Gitlab, Github, and Trello. Just send a message to notifine or add it to your telegram group. It will provide you with a webhook link right away. Copy this link and paste it to your favorite tool (only GitLab now).

## Available Notifications

### Github and GitLab

‚úÖ Commit push  
 ‚úÖ Tag push  
 ‚úÖ Pipeline  
 ‚úÖ Pull request (via Job events)  
 ‚úÖ Job events  
 ‚úÖ Issue  
 ‚úÖ Comment  
 ‚úÖ Deployment notifications

## ‚ú® Features

**üòé 100% open source and free**

Backend (Rust) and infrastructure codes (AWS CDK) are open sources.

**üöÄ Uptime guarantee**

There are some telegram bots available already. But they are not able to provide a continuous experience because of long downtimes. This is the main reason for the existence of notifine.

Check the uptime status of the bots: https://stats.uptimerobot.com/5zQqxuMGNY

**üéì Educational purposes**

I am planning to prepare a tutorial based on this project. And help new Rustaceans with an up-to-date Rust implementation.

**‚ö°Ô∏è Built on Rust**

Benefit Rust features of speed, type safety, async.

**üîå On premise available**

If you want to host the bot on your private server.

## Notes

Gitlab sends a job event for each PR event. So, to avoid duplicate notifications, we use job events instead of PR events. If you want to test PR events, you should select Job event and click test on Gitlab

**Telegram threads (topics) are now supported:**
After adding the bot to the group, simply execute the /start command in the thread where you want to receive notifications.

## Branch Filtering

Both GitHub and GitLab webhooks support branch filtering to reduce notification noise from development branches. Add query parameters to your webhook URL to filter events by branch patterns.

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Only receive notifications for main branch
https://webhook.notifine.com/github/webhook123?branch=main
https://webhook.notifine.com/gitlab/webhook123?branch=main

# Multiple branches
https://webhook.notifine.com/github/webhook123?branch=main,develop

# Wildcard patterns
https://webhook.notifine.com/github/webhook123?branch=release/*

# Exclude development branches
https://webhook.notifine.com/github/webhook123?exclude_branch=feature/*,dependabot/*

# Combine include and exclude (exclude takes precedence)
https://webhook.notifine.com/github/webhook123?branch=main,release/*&exclude_branch=*-wip,*-temp
```

### Supported Events

**GitHub:** Push events, Pull Request events, Workflow Run events, Create/Delete events
**GitLab:** Push events, Merge Request events

### Filter Rules

- **Include patterns** (`branch=`): Only process events for matching branches
- **Exclude patterns** (`exclude_branch=`): Never process events for matching branches
- **Precedence**: Exclusions take priority over inclusions
- **Wildcards**: Use `*` for pattern matching (e.g., `feature/*`, `*-wip`)
- **Multiple patterns**: Separate with commas (`main,develop,release/*`)

### Backward Compatibility

- Webhooks without branch filters continue to receive all events
- GitLab's existing `?full_message=true` parameter still works alongside branch filtering
